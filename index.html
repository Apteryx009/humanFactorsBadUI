        <h2>Our History</h2>
	<p>The Retro Cafe has been serving up delicious food and good times in San Marcos, Texas for over 30 years. Founded in 1984 by Keanu Reeves, our shop quickly became a local favorite thanks to our unique retro vibe and mouthwatering menu.</p>
	<p>Over the years, we've expanded our menu to include a wide range of dishes that cater to all tastes and dietary needs. From classic burgers and fries to vegan options and gluten-free desserts, we've got something for everyone.</p>
	<p>But despite our growth and success, we've never lost sight of our roots. We're still a family-owned and operated business, and we're proud to be a part of the San Marcos community. We believe that good food and good company can bring people together, and we strive to create a welcoming atmosphere where everyone feels at home.</p>
	<p>So whether you're a long-time regular or a first-time visitor, we invite you to come and experience The Retro Cafe for yourself. We can't wait to see you!</p>
